# Binary String

## Overview

The Binary String is an ASP.NET MVC web application that allows users to input a binary string and determine if the string is "good" based on two key conditions:
1. The binary string must contain an equal number of `0`s and `1`s.
2. For every prefix of the binary string, the number of `1`s should not be less than the number of `0`s.

The application is interactive, providing real-time feedback about whether the binary string satisfies these criteria. AJAX is used to handle form submissions and update the result dynamically without reloading the page.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the application on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- .NET Framework (Version 4.7 or higher)
- Visual Studio (Any edition that supports ASP.NET MVC)
- NuGet Package Manager (Installed with Visual Studio)

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shabbir-bharmal/task-binary-string-analysis-function.git
   cd task-binary-string-analysis-function
   ```

2. Open the Solution:
   Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio to load the project.

3. Restore NuGet Packages:
   In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages".

4. Run the Application:
   Press `F5` or click on the Start button to run the application. It will open in your default web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the form on the homepage to input binary strings and evaluate them.

1. Input a binary string in the provided text box (e.g., `1100`).
2. Click the "Check" button to submit the string.
3. The application will determine whether the string is "good" or "not good" based on the rules outlined below:
   - Equal number of `0`s and `1`s.
   - For each prefix, the number of `1`s must not be less than the number of `0`s.

The result will be shown below the input field along with any relevant error messages.

## Example Inputs

| `11110000`   | Valid           | Valid binary string.          |
| ` `          | InValid         | Binary string can't be empty! |
## Features

- **Binary String Validation:** Validates that the input binary string meets the criteria described.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Results are displayed instantly after submitting the form using AJAX.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback for invalid inputs, such as empty strings or non-binary characters.
- **Form Validation:** Prevents submission if the input is not valid.

## Testing the Application

### Manual Testing

To manually test the application:

1. Launch the application in your browser.
2. Enter various binary strings in the input field and press Check.
3. Observe the results. Try edge cases like:
   - Strings with more `0`s than `1`s.
   - Strings with non-binary characters (like `2` or `A`).
   - Empty input strings.

### Example Test Cases

## Code Structure

### Models

- **BinaryStringModel.cs:**
   - Contains the `BinaryString` property for input.
   - Implements the method `CheckIfGood()` to evaluate whether the string is "good" based on the validation criteria.

### Views

- **Index.cshtml:**
   - Contains the input form for binary strings.
   - Displays the result of the validation and handles the form submission using AJAX.

### Controllers

- **BinaryController.cs:**
   - Receives the form submission.
   - Calls the model's validation logic and returns a JSON result to the view for displaying the outcome.

### Scripts

- **AJAX (in the view):**
   - Manages the form submission and updates the result dynamically without refreshing the page.
